# interactive-form-v2
Team Treehouse Unit Project 3

This project was about creating a registration form for a fictional conference. I was able to demonstrate my skills to add customization and conditional behavior as well as interactivity. Regular Expressions were used to validate name, email, activities, and payment methods.
